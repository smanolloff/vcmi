- mapeditor does not detect changes if only army is modified
- mapeditor does not remove creatures from army if they are set to "", but the count is >0
- summoning demons prevents summon elementals
- summoning elements causes random creature "cast" animation (manticores)
  (i believe same applies to all spells)
