====
training maps with duplicate hero types ("core:sylvia") are not properly
(de-)serialized as only the hero type ID is serialized.
Since gs->allheroes keeps a single record per hero type (a total of 165),
this ID corresponds to the first hero of this type.
The client deserializes it and, as a result, client side's battle info
contains the wrong CGHeroInstance objects. This is not critical (for now) as
some client-side checks like "can cast spell" throw warnings, but everything
ultimately works OK on the server side.
HOWEVER, the CGArmyInstances are properly deserialized.
