1. check if bonus SHOOTER is same as shots 
2. check if NOT_ACTIVE bonus is used
3. check if GENERAL_ATTACK_REDUCTION is affected by FORGETFUL
  (and remove FORGETFUL if so)

4. (optional) Handle spellcast of LAND MINE - probably there's something
  like a list of affected hexes, and return them with the appropriate
  HEX_STATE. This would make sense only if the agent uses LSTM though.

5. CBattleInfoCallback::getRandomCastedSpell
  seems to check only if stack has bonus `SPELLCASTER`
  What about `RANDOM_SPELLCASTER` (Genie)?
  Does it have both?

6. Use pybind11 STL
